Thanks for the feedback. I'm definitely looking back at the story occasionally to see where edits are needed. I'll look in more detail at the first half compared to the last half. I know I was writing it in a different headspace, which no doubt had a lot to do with it. The first half I forced myself to write but didn't like it. The second was a combination of forcing myself to do something I liked and just letting it flow. 

And no, I wasn't thinking about Abigail. Funny.

I like the direction of your thoughts, blending detail with the abstract and the general palette of pastel/water colours. Perhaps, given the first couple of sketches, we could think of something where the characters (or just the animals, or just the animals and Sam) are drawn boldly (maybe even in charcoal) and the rest are in watercolour.
