Ok, I'm done with the first story.

Things to be known: 
*I'm thinking of calling the series the Chase St. Pet Co-op. 

*I'm envisioning the pets discussed in the stories to be as big as horses in the accompanying pictures. But in the writing, I'm not referring to their size (for the most part). Examine, if you will, the idea that someone a cat gets from a yard to a sidewalk, overcoming the separating fence. One would think the cat could slink in between the pickets. However, a little ambiguity in the writing and it allows you to show the big big cat hopping over the fence quite easily.

*I imagine some of the description can disappear to make a tighter piece, in light of representative art. I can't seem to write in anyway but to be incredibly descriptive, so things might be a little wordy. 

Other than that. Enjoy, I hope :)




...Chase St. Pet Co-op sounds...well, stupid.
