I really enjoyed the story. The first scene seemed to drag out a little bit, but after that it hit a stride that worked well. The descriptions in the last half are a lot stronger than from the first half, they seem to flow better, and I got a better idea of what was going on.

I liked the theme of a kid learning to remember his mother's birthday, and being led through the paces of figuring everything out, rather than just having everything.handed to him.

I dont know why, but I really liked the detail of the street address at the very end. It just puncuated the story, brought everything to a close. Nicely done.

I can see what you mean about larger than life animals (BTW, is Albert the cat based on Abigail?). I'm seeing a rather round style of character, in a water color or pastel style. I am thinking of opportunities to do detailed illustrations, but also blend into more abstract features, like how memories are fuzzy on the edges, and trying to focus on them makes them distort and fade and become featureless.

Anywah, good jorb.
